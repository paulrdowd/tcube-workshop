# The Raven

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow

#bad poetry
a cup of sugar from the neighbour next door, what for?
Why to have a cup of tea, the drink which I so adore.
